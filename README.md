### Project Overview
The "[Failed Banks Analytics](https://github.com/OLUJUWON-OMOTOBA/Project-6/blob/main/Failed%20Banks.pbix)" Power BI project is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of failed banks, including details such as their names, dates of closure, and locations. This project involves collecting, analyzing, and visualizing data related to failed banks, empowering stakeholders with insights into historical trends and patterns. Here's an overview of key components and features that might be included in the "Failed Banks Analytics" Power BI project:

1. **Data Sources:**
   - Failed Banks Data: Information about failed banks, including their names, dates of closure, and locations.
   - Historical Data: Additional context, such as economic indicators or regulatory changes, that might be relevant to bank failures.

2. **Key Metrics and KPIs:**
   - **Number of Failed Banks:** The total count of banks that have failed.
   - **Closure Rate Over Time:** Trends and patterns in the rate at which banks are closing over different time periods.

3. **Dashboard and Visualizations:**
   - **Failed Banks Overview:** Visual representation of the total number of failed banks, highlighting any significant spikes or trends.
   - **Closure Dates Distribution:** Histogram or timeline visualizing the distribution of closure dates.
   - **Geographical Map:** Mapping the locations of failed banks to identify clusters or patterns.

4. **Time-Based Analysis:**
   - Trends in the frequency of bank closures over different time intervals (monthly, yearly).
   - Seasonal variations and their impact on bank closures.

5. **Location-Based Analysis:**
   - Heatmap or geospatial visualization of failed banks across different regions or states.
   - Regional breakdowns to identify areas with a higher concentration of closures.

6. **Interactive Reports:**
   - Reports that allow users to interact with the data, filter information based on specific criteria, and drill down into detailed insights.


The "Failed Banks Analytics" Power BI project serves as a powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of bank failures, identifying patterns, and potentially predicting future trends. It provides stakeholders with the information needed to make informed decisions in the context of the financial landscape.
